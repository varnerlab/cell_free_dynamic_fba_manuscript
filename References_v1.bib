	Abstract = {An overview is presented of the different approximative enzyme kinetic formats that have been proposed for use in metabolic modeling studies. It is considered that the following four general properties are relevant for approximative kinetics: the rate must be proportional to enzyme level; at high metabolite concentrations, there is downward concave behavior of rate versus concentration; the number of kinetic parameters should be as small as possible; analytical solutions of steady-state network balances are desirable. Six different approximative kinetic formats are evaluated (linear, logarithmic-linear, power law GMA, power law S-systems, thermokinetic, linear-logarithmic) and it is concluded that only the recently proposed linear-logarithmic approach combines all desired properties and therefore seems a most appropriate approximate kinetic format.},

	Abstract = {Mechanistic biochemical network models describe the dynamics of intracellular metabolite pools in terms of substance concentrations, stoichiometry and reaction kinetics. Data from stimulus response experiments are currently the most informative source for in-vivo parameter estimation in such models. However, only a part of the parameters of classical enzyme kinetic models can usually be estimated from typical stimulus response data. For this reason, several alternative kinetic formats using different "languages'' (e. g. linear, power laws, linlog, generic and convenience) have been proposed to reduce the model complexity. The present contribution takes a rigorous "multi-lingual'' approach to data evaluation by translating biochemical network models from one kinetic format into another. For this purpose, a new high-performance algorithm has been developed and tested. Starting with a given model, it replaces as many kinetic terms as possible by alternative expressions while still reproducing the experimental data. Application of the algorithm to a published model for Escherichia coli's sugar metabolism demonstrates the power of the new method. It is shown that model translation is a powerful tool to investigate the information content of stimulus response data and the predictive power of models. Moreover, the local and global approximation capabilities of the models are elucidated and some pitfalls of traditional single model approaches to data evaluation are revealed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

@article{1991_savageau_JTheorBio,
	Abstract = {An appropriate language or formalism for the analysis of complex biochemical systems has been sought for several decades. The necessity for such a formalism results from the large number of interacting components in biochemical systems and the complex non-linear character of these interactions. The Power-Law Formalism, an example of such a language, underlies several recent attempts to develop an understanding of integrated biochemical systems. It is the simplest representation of integrated biochemical systems that has been shown to be consistent with well-known growth laws and allometric relationships--the most regular, quantitative features that have been observed among the systemic variables of complex biochemical systems. The Power-Law Formalism provides the basis for Biochemical Systems Theory, which includes several different strategies of representation. Among these, the synergistic-system (S-system) representation is the most useful, as judged by a variety of objective criteria. This paper first describes the predominant features of the S-system representation. It then presents detailed comparisons between the S-system representation and other variants within Biochemical Systems Theory. These comparisons are made on the basis of objective criteria that characterize the efficiency, power, clarity and scope of each representation. Two of the variants within Biochemical Systems Theory are intimately related to other approaches for analyzing biochemical systems, namely Metabolic Control Theory and Flux-Oriented Theory. It is hoped that the comparisons presented here will result in a deeper understanding of the relationships among these variants. Finally, some recent developments are described that demonstrate the potential for further growth of Biochemical Systems Theory and the underlying Power-Law Formalism on which it is based.},

@article{2003_visser_heijnen_MetabEng,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a new mathematical framework for modeling of in vivo dynamics and for metabolic re-design: the linlog approach. This approach is an extension of metabolic control analysis (MCA), valid for large changes of enzyme and metabolite levels. Furthermore, the presented framework combines MCA with kinetic modeling, thereby also combining the merits of both approaches. The linlog framework includes general expressions giving the steady-state fluxes and metabolite concentrations as a function of enzyme levels and extracellular concentrations, and a metabolic design equation that allows direct calculation of required enzyme levels for a desired steady state when control and response coefficients are available. Expressions giving control coefficients as a function of the enzyme levels are also derived. The validity of the linlog approximation in metabolic modeling is demonstrated by application of linlog kinetics to a branched pathway with moiety conservation, reversible reactions and allosteric interactions. Results show that the linlog approximation is able to describe the non-linear dynamics of this pathway very well for concentration changes up to a factor 20. Also the metabolic design equation was tested successfully.},

@article{Gadkar:2005aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent advances in molecular biology techniques provide an opportunity for developing detailed mathematical models of biological processes. An iterative scheme is introduced for model identification using available system knowledge and experimental measurements.
RESULTS: The scheme includes a state regulator algorithm that provides estimates of all system unknowns (concentrations of the system components and the reaction rates of their inter-conversion). The full system information is used for estimation of the model parameters. An optimal experiment design using the parameter identifiability and D-optimality criteria is formulated to provide "rich" experimental data for maximizing the accuracy of the parameter estimates in subsequent iterations. The importance of model identifiability tests for optimal measurement selection is also considered. The iterative scheme is tested on a model for the caspase function in apoptosis where it is demonstrated that model accuracy improves with each iteration. Optimal experiment design was determined to be critical for model identification.
CONCLUSION: The proposed algorithm has general application to modeling a wide range of cellular processes, which include gene regulation networks, signal transduction and metabolic networks.},

The growth of the organisms is described in a bioreactor in which one substrate is fed into the reactor with a given feed rate and feed concentration. Measurements for some intracellular components are provided representing a small biochemical network. Problems of reverse engineering, parameter estimation, and identifiability are addressed. The contribution mainly focuses on the problem of model discrimination. If two or more model variants describe the available experimental data, a new experiment must be designed to discriminate between the hypothetical models. For the problem presented, the feed rate and feed concentration of a bioreactor system are available as control inputs. To verify calculated input profiles an interactive Web site (http://www.sysbio.de/projects/benchmark/) is provided. Several solutions based on linear and nonlinear models are discussed.},

@article{Song:2010ab,
	Abstract = {Mathematical modeling of complex gene expression programs is an emerging tool for understanding disease mechanisms. However, identification of large models sometimes requires training using qualitative, conflicting or even contradictory data sets. One strategy to address this challenge is to estimate experimentally constrained model ensembles using multiobjective optimization. In this study, we used Pareto Optimal Ensemble Techniques (POETs) to identify a family of proof-of-concept signal transduction models. POETs integrate Simulated Annealing (SA) with Pareto optimality to identify models near the optimal tradeoff surface between competing training objectives. We modeled a prototypical-signaling network using mass-action kinetics within an ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework (64 ODEs in total). The true model was used to generate synthetic immunoblots from which the POET algorithm identified the 117 unknown model parameters. POET generated an ensemble of signaling models, which collectively exhibited population-like behavior. For example, scaled gene expression levels were approximately normally distributed over the ensemble following the addition of extracellular ligand. Also, the ensemble recovered robust and fragile features of the true model, despite significant parameter uncertainty. Taken together, these results suggest that experimentally constrained model ensembles could capture qualitatively important network features without exact parameter information.},

	Abstract = {Recent data suggest that the majority of proteins bind specific metabolites and that such interactions are relevant to metabolic and gene regulation. However, there are no methods to systematically identify functional allosteric protein-metabolite interactions. Here we present an experimental and computational approach for using dynamic metabolite data to discover allosteric regulation that is relevant in vivo. By switching the culture conditions of Escherichia coli every 30 s between medium containing either pyruvate or (13)C-labeled fructose or glucose, we measured the reversal of flux through glycolysis pathways and observed rapid changes in metabolite concentration. We fit these data to a kinetic model of glycolysis and systematically tested the consequences of 126 putative allosteric interactions on metabolite dynamics. We identified allosteric interactions that govern the reversible switch between gluconeogenesis and glycolysis, including one by which pyruvate activates fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Thus, from large sets of putative allosteric interactions, our approach can identify the most likely ones and provide hypotheses about their function.},

@article{Tran:2008aa,
	Abstract = {Complete modeling of metabolic networks is desirable, but it is difficult to accomplish because of the lack of kinetics. As a step toward this goal, we have developed an approach to build an ensemble of dynamic models that reach the same steady state. The models in the ensemble are based on the same mechanistic framework at the elementary reaction level, including known regulations, and span the space of all kinetics allowable by thermodynamics. This ensemble allows for the examination of possible phenotypes of the network upon perturbations, such as changes in enzyme expression levels. The size of the ensemble is reduced by acquiring data for such perturbation phenotypes. If the mechanistic framework is approximately accurate, the ensemble converges to a smaller set of models and becomes more predictive. This approach bypasses the need for detailed characterization of kinetic parameters and arrives at a set of models that describes relevant phenotypes upon enzyme perturbations.},

@article{2009_song_ramkrishna_BiotechBioeng,
	Abstract = {The hybrid cybernetic modeling approach of Kim et al. (Kim et al. [2008] Biotechnol. Prog., in press) views the substrate uptake flux in microorganisms as being distributed in a regulated way among different elementary modes (EMs) of a metabolic network, which intracellular fluxes related to the uptake rates by the pseudo-steady-state approximation on intracellular metabolites. While the conceptual development has been demonstrated by Kim et al. (Kim et al. [2008] Biotechnol. Prog., in press) using a rather simple example (i.e., Escherichia coli metabolizing a single substrate), its extension to a larger scale network involving multiple substrates results in serious overparameterization (which implies an excessive number of parameters relative to the measurements available to determine them). Through the case study of recombinant Saccharomyces yeast co-consuming glucose and xylose, we present a systematic way of formulating a minimal order hybrid cybernetic model (HCM) for a general metabolic network. The overparameterization problem mostly arising from a large number of EMs is avoided using a model reduction technique developed by Song and Ramkrishna (Song and Ramkrishna [2009a] Biotechnol. Bioeng. 102(2):554-568) where an original set of EMs is condensed to a much smaller subset. Detailed discussions follow on the issue of determining the minimal set of active modes needed for the description of the simultaneous consumption of multiple substrates. The developed HCM is compared with other metabolic models: macroscopic bioreaction models (Provost et al. [2006] Bioprocess Biosyt. Eng. 29(5-6):349-366), and dynamic flux balance analysis. It is shown that the HCM outperforms the other two as validated using various sets of fermentation data. The difference among the models is more dramatic in a situation such as the sequential utilization of glucose and xylose, which is observed under realistic fermentation conditions.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a kinetic model of phosphofructokinase-1 from Escherichia coli. A complete catalytic cycle has been reconstructed based on available information on the oligomeric structure of the enzyme and kinetic mechanism of its monomer. Applying the generalization of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux approach proposed by Popova and Sel'kov(35-37) to the reconstructed catalytic cycle rate equation has been derived. Dependence of the reaction rate on pH, magnesium, and effectors has been taken into account. Kinetic parameters have been estimated via fitting the rate equation against experimentally measured dependencies of initial rate on substrates, products, effectors, and pH available from the literature. The model of phosphofructokinase-1 predicts (1) cooperativity of binding both fructose-6-phosphate and ATPMg(2-), (2) significant inhibition of the enzyme resulting from an increase in total concentration of ATP under the condition of fixed concentration of Mg(2+) ions, and (3) dual effect of ADP consisting of allosteric activation and product inhibition of the enzyme. Moreover, the model developed can be used in the kinetic modeling of biochemical pathways containing phosphofructokinase-1.},

A total of 907 allosteric site-modulator structural complexes and >200 structural pairs of orthosteric/allosteric sites in the allosteric proteins were constructed for researchers to develop allosteric site and pathway tools in response to community demands. Up-to-date allosteric pathways were manually curated in the updated version. In addition, both the front-end and the back-end of ASD have been redesigned and enhanced to allow more efficient access.

	Abstract = {Insulin, the primary hormone regulating the level of glucose in the bloodstream, modulates a variety of cellular and enzymatic processes in normal and diseased cells. Insulin signals are processed by a complex network of biochemical interactions which ultimately induce gene expression programs or other processes such as translation initiation. Surprisingly, despite the wealth of literature on insulin signaling, the relative importance of the components linking insulin with translation initiation remains unclear. We addressed this question by developing and interrogating a family of mathematical models of insulin induced translation initiation. The insulin network was modeled using mass-action kinetics within an ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework. A family of model parameters was estimated, starting from an initial best fit parameter set, using 24 experimental data sets taken from literature. The residual between model simulations and each of the experimental constraints were simultaneously minimized using multiobjective optimization. Interrogation of the model population, using sensitivity and robustness analysis, identified an insulin-dependent switch that controlled translation initiation. Our analysis suggested that without insulin, a balance between the pro-initiation activity of the GTP-binding protein Rheb and anti-initiation activity of PTEN controlled basal initiation. On the other hand, in the presence of insulin a combination of PI3K and Rheb activity controlled inducible initiation, where PI3K was only critical in the presence of insulin. Other well known regulatory mechanisms governing insulin action, for example IRS-1 negative feedback, modulated the relative importance of PI3K and Rheb but did not fundamentally change the signal flow.},

	Abstract = {Programmed protein synthesis plays an important role in the cell cycle. Deregulated translation has been observed in several cancers. In this study, the authors constructed an ensemble of mathematical models describing the integration of growth factor signals with translation initiation. Using these models, the authors estimated critical structural features of the translation architecture. Sensitivity and robustness analysis with and without growth factors suggested that a balance between competing regulatory programmes governed translation initiation. Proteins such as Akt and mTor promoted initiation by integrating growth factor signals with the assembly of the 80S initiation complex. However, negative regulators such as PTEN and 4EBP1 restrained initiation in the absence of stimulation. Other proteins such as eIF4E were also found to be structurally critical as deletion of amplification of these components resulted in a network incapable of nominal operation. These findings could help understand the molecular basis of translation deregulation observed in cancer and perhaps lead to new anti-cancer therapeutic strategies.

	Abstract = {Manipulation of differentiation programs has therapeutic potential in a spectrum of human cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we integrated computational and experimental methods to unravel the response of a lineage uncommitted precursor cell-line, HL-60, to Retinoic Acid (RA). HL-60 is a human myeloblastic leukemia cell-line used extensively to study human differentiation programs. Initially, we focused on the role of the BLR1 receptor in RA-induced differentiation and G1/0-arrest in HL-60. BLR1, a putative G protein-coupled receptor expressed following RA exposure, is required for RA-induced cell-cycle arrest and differentiation and causes persistent MAPK signaling. A mathematical model of RA-induced cell-cycle arrest and differentiation was formulated and tested against BLR1 wild-type (wt) knock-out and knock-in HL-60 cell-lines with and without RA. The current model described the dynamics of 729 proteins and protein complexes interconnected by 1356 interactions. An ensemble strategy was used to compensate for uncertain model parameters. The ensemble of HL-60 models recapitulated the positive feedback between BLR1 and MAPK signaling. The ensemble of models also correctly predicted Rb and p47phox regulation and the correlation between p21-CDK4-cyclin D formation and G1/0-arrest following exposure to RA. Finally, we investigated the robustness of the HL-60 network architecture to structural perturbations and generated experimentally testable hypotheses for future study. Taken together, the model presented here was a first step toward a systematic framework for analysis of programmed differentiation. These studies also demonstrated that mechanistic network modeling can help prioritize experimental directions by generating falsifiable hypotheses despite uncertainty.},

	Abstract = {Androgen ablation therapy is currently the primary treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. Unfortunately, in nearly all cases, androgen ablation fails to permanently arrest cancer progression. As androgens like testosterone are withdrawn, prostate cancer cells lose their androgen sensitivity and begin to proliferate without hormone growth factors. In this study, we constructed and analyzed a mathematical model of the integration between hormone growth factor signaling, androgen receptor activation, and the expression of cyclin D and Prostate-Specific Antigen in human LNCaP prostate adenocarcinoma cells. The objective of the study was to investigate which signaling systems were important in the loss of androgen dependence. The model was formulated as a set of ordinary differential equations which described 212 species and 384 interactions, including both the mRNA and protein levels for key species. An ensemble approach was chosen to constrain model parameters and to estimate the impact of parametric uncertainty on model predictions. Model parameters were identified using 14 steady-state and dynamic LNCaP data sets taken from literature sources. Alterations in the rate of Prostatic Acid Phosphatase expression was sufficient to capture varying levels of androgen dependence. Analysis of the model provided insight into the importance of network components as a function of androgen dependence. The importance of androgen receptor availability and the MAPK/Akt signaling axes was independent of androgen status. Interestingly, androgen receptor availability was important even in androgen-independent LNCaP cells. Translation became progressively more important in androgen-independent LNCaP cells. Further analysis suggested a positive synergy between the MAPK and Akt signaling axes and the translation of key proliferative markers like cyclin D in androgen-independent cells. Taken together, the results support the targeting of both the Akt and MAPK pathways. Moreover, the analysis suggested that direct targeting of the translational machinery, specifically eIF4E, could be efficacious in androgen-independent prostate cancers.},

	Abstract = {Intracellular calcium dynamics are critical to cellular functions like pain transmission. Extracellular ATP plays an important role in modulating intracellular calcium levels by interacting with the P2 family of surface receptors. In this study, we developed a mechanistic mathematical model of ATP-induced P2 mediated calcium signaling in archetype sensory neurons. The model architecture, which described 90 species connected by 162 interactions, was formulated by aggregating disparate molecular modules from literature. Unlike previous models, only mass action kinetics were used to describe the rate of molecular interactions. Thus, the majority of the 252 unknown model parameters were either association, dissociation or catalytic rate constants. Model parameters were estimated from nine independent data sets taken from multiple laboratories. The training data consisted of both dynamic and steady-state measurements. However, because of the complexity of the calcium network, we were unable to estimate unique model parameters. Instead, we estimated a family or ensemble of probable parameter sets using a multi-objective thermal ensemble method. Each member of the ensemble met an error criterion and was located along or near the optimal trade-off surface between the individual training data sets. The model quantitatively reproduced experimental measurements from dorsal root ganglion neurons as a function of extracellular ATP forcing. Hypothesized architecture linking phosphoinositide regulation with P2X receptor activity explained the inhibition of P2X-mediated current flow by activated metabotropic P2Y receptors. Sensitivity analysis using individual and the whole system outputs suggested which molecular subsystems were most important following P2 activation. Taken together, modeling and analysis of ATP-induced P2 mediated calcium signaling generated qualitative insight into the critical interactions controlling ATP induced calcium dynamics. Understanding these critical interactions may prove useful for the design of the next generation of molecular pain management strategies.},

	Abstract = {The role that mechanistic mathematical modeling and systems biology will play in molecular medicine and clinical development remains uncertain. In this study, mathematical modeling and sensitivity analysis were used to explore the working hypothesis that mechanistic models of human cascades, despite model uncertainty, can be computationally screened for points of fragility, and that these sensitive mechanisms could serve as therapeutic targets. We tested our working hypothesis by screening a model of the well-studied coagulation cascade, developed and validated from literature. The predicted sensitive mechanisms were then compared with the treatment literature. The model, composed of 92 proteins and 148 protein-protein interactions, was validated using 21 published datasets generated from two different quiescent in vitro coagulation models. Simulated platelet activation and thrombin generation profiles in the presence and absence of natural anticoagulants were consistent with measured values, with a mean correlation of 0.87 across all trials. Overall state sensitivity coefficients, which measure the robustness or fragility of a given mechanism, were calculated using a Monte Carlo strategy. In the absence of anticoagulants, fluid and surface phase factor X/activated factor X (fX/FXa) activity and thrombin-mediated platelet activation were found to be fragile, while fIX/FIXa and fVIII/FVIIIa activation and activity were robust. Both anti-fX/FXa and direct thrombin inhibitors are important classes of anticoagulants; for example, anti-fX/FXa inhibitors have FDA approval for the prevention of venous thromboembolism following surgical intervention and as an initial treatment for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Both in vitro and in vivo experimental evidence is reviewed supporting the prediction that fIX/FIXa activity is robust. When taken together, these results support our working hypothesis that computationally derived points of fragility of human relevant cascades could be used as a rational basis for target selection despite model uncertainty.},

These systems have large numbers of poorly known parameters, simplified dynamics, and uncertain connectivity: three key features of a class of problems we call sloppy models, which are shared by many other high-dimensional multiparameter nonlinear models. We use a statistical ensemble method to study the behavior of these models, in order to extract as much useful predictive information as possible from a sloppy model, given the available data used to constrain it. We discuss numerical challenges that emerge in using the ensemble method for a large system. We characterize features of sloppy model parameter fluctuations by various spectral decompositions and find indeed that five parameters can be used to fit an elephant. We also find that model entropy is as important to the problem of model choice as model energy is to parameter choice.},

A cybernetic model of PHB synthesis in Alcaligenes eutrophus is developed. Model parameters are identified using experimental data, and simulation results are presented. The model is interfaced to a multirate model predictive control (MPC) algorithm. PHB productivity and concentration are controlled by manipulating dilution rate and recycle ratio. Unmeasured time varying disturbances are imposed to study regulatory control performance, including unreachable setpoints. With proper controller tuning, the nonlinear MPC algorithm can track productivity and concentration setpoints despite a change in the sign of PHB productivity gain with respect to dilution rate. It is shown that the nonlinear MPC algorithm is able to track the maximum achievable productivity for unreachable setpoints under significant process/model mismatch. The impact of model uncertainty upon controller performance is explored. The multirate MPC algorithm is tested using three controllers employing models that vary in complexity of regulation. It is shown that controller performance deteriorates as a function of decreasing biological complexity.},

@article{Song:2010aa,
	Abstract = {Motivated by the need for a quick quantitative assessment of metabolic function without extensive data, we present an adaptation of the cybernetic framework, denoted as the lumped hybrid cybernetic model (L-HCM), which combines the attributes of the classical lumped cybernetic model (LCM) and the recently developed HCM. The basic tenet of L-HCM and HCM is the same, that is, they both view the uptake flux as being split among diverse pathways in an optimal way as a result of cellular regulation such that some chosen metabolic objective is realized. The L-HCM, however, portrays this flux distribution to occur in a hierarchical way, that is, first among lumped pathways, and next among individual elementary modes (EM) in each lumped pathway. Both splits are described by the cybernetic control laws using operational and structural return-on-investments, respectively. That is, the distribution of uptake flux at the first split is dynamically regulated according to environmental conditions, while the subsequent split is based purely on the stoichiometry of EMs. The resulting model is conveniently represented in terms of lumped pathways which are fully identified with respect to yield coefficients of all products unlike classical LCMs based on instinctive lumping. These characteristics enable the model to account for the complete set of EMs for arbitrarily large metabolic networks despite containing only a small number of parameters which can be identified using minimal data. However, the inherent conflict of questing for quantification of larger networks with smaller number of parameters cannot be resolved without a mechanism for parameter tuning of an empirical nature. In this work, this is accomplished by manipulating the relative importance of EMs by tuning the cybernetic control of mode-averaged enzyme activity with an empirical parameter. In a case study involving aerobic batch growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, L-HCM is compared with LCM. The former provides a much more satisfactory prediction than the latter when parameters are identified from a few primary metabolites. On the other hand, the classical model is more accurate than L-HCM when sufficient datasets are involved in parameter identification. In applying the two models to a chemostat scenario, L-HCM shows a reasonable prediction on metabolic shift from respiration to fermentation due to the Crabtree effect, which LCM predicts unsatisfactorily. While L-HCM appears amenable to expeditious estimates of metabolic function with minimal data, the more detailed dynamic models [such as HCM or those of Young et al. (Young et al., Biotechnol Bioeng, 2008; 100: 542-559)] are best suited for accurate treatment of metabolism when the potential of modern omic technology is fully realized. However, in view of the monumental effort surrounding the development of detailed models from extensive omic measurements, the preliminary insight into the behavior of a genotype and metabolic engineering directives that can come from L-HCM is indeed valuable.},

	Abstract = {In a recent article, Song and Ramkrishna (Song and Ramkrishna [2010]. Biotechnol Bioeng 106(2):271-284) proposed a lumped hybrid cybernetic model (L-HCM) towards extracting maximum information about metabolic function from a minimum of data. This approach views the total uptake flux as distributed among lumped elementary modes (L-EMs) so as to maximize a prescribed metabolic objective such as growth or uptake rate. L-EM is computed as a weighted average of EMs where the weights are related to the yields of vital products (i.e., biomass and ATP). In this article, we further enhance the predictive power of L-HCMs through modifications in lumping weights with additional parameters that can be tuned with data viewed to be critical. The resulting model is able to make predictions of diverse metabolic behaviors varying greatly with strain types as evidenced from case studies of anaerobic growth of various Escherichia coli strains. Incorporation of the new lumping formula into L-HCM remarkably improves model predictions with a few critical data, thus presenting L-HCM as a dynamic tool as being not only qualitatively correct but also quantitatively accurate.},

	Abstract = {The capability to gather organism wide data has far outstripped the ability to understand it. Transforming large-scale data into a "better" cell requires tools that integrate physiology with its environment. One such tool is large-scale mathematical models that marry stoichiometry and kinetics with metabolic regulation and control. It is straightforward to determine stoichiometry (at least for central pathways), and kinetics can be roughly approximated where need be. However, the molecular details of the "metabolic wiring" managing the cell are often missing. Presented here is a surrogate for these missing details based on a simple premise; over evolutionary time, biological systems have developed objective-based programs that frugally manage gene expression and enzyme activity. Mathematically, this notion can be represented as sets of nonlinear control or "management" problems which, when solved in parallel with the model balances, offer a prediction of how gene expression and enzyme activity are modulated, in the absence of specific mechanistic details. We present a model of Escherichia coli central carbon metabolism, describing batch aerobic growth on glucose, in which transcription, translation, and activity of the gene products of 45 genes is "managed" using this approach. The model consists of 122 species (metabolites, enzymes, mRNA pools, and biomass) and describes 46 reactions (17 reversible). The model is identified (kinetic parameters as well as management structure) from metabolic flux ratio (METAFoR) analysis and physiological measurements. Simulations of a pyruvate kinase knockout strain are compared with experiments and it is shown the model is capable of accurately capturing the metabolic reprogramming resulting from the deletion. Analysis of the mRNA expression pattern, translational pattern and enzyme activity pattern of the wild-type versus mutant indicates a combination of expression and specific activity shifts are responsible for observed differences. While being only a first step toward large-scale physiological modeling, this work is important in two ways. First, it strengthens the hypothesis that unknown mechanism can be reasonably approximated using objective-based management criteria. Second, it provides a dynamic means to couple large-scale analysis technologies with physiology at the single-gene, single-protein level.},

	Abstract = {Metabolic engineering is the field of introducing genetic changes in organisms so as to modify their function towards synthesizing new products of high impact to society. However, engineered cells frequently have impaired growth rates thus seriously limiting the rate at which such products are made. The problem is attributable to inadequate understanding of how a metabolic network functions in a dynamic sense. Predictions of mutant strain behavior in the past have been based on steady state theories such as flux balance analysis (FBA), minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA), and regulatory on/off minimization (ROOM). Such predictions are restricted to product yields and cannot address productivity, which is of focal interest to applications. We demonstrate that our framework ( [Song and Ramkrishna, 2010] and [Song and Ramkrishna, 2011]), based on a ``cybernetic'' view of metabolic systems, makes predictions of the dynamic behavior of mutant strains of Escherichia coli from a limited amount of data obtained from the wild-type. Dynamic frameworks must necessarily address the issue of metabolic regulation, which the cybernetic approach does by postulating that metabolism is an optimal dynamic response of the organism to the environment in driving reactions towards ensuring survival. The predictions made in this paper are without parallel in the literature and lay the foundation for rational metabolic engineering.},

	Abstract = {The flood of high-throughput biological data has led to the expectation that computational (or in silico) models can be used to direct biological discovery, enabling biologists to reconcile heterogeneous data types, find inconsistencies and systematically generate hypotheses. Such a process is fundamentally iterative, where each iteration involves making model predictions, obtaining experimental data, reconciling the predicted outcomes with experimental ones, and using discrepancies to update the in silico model. Here we have reconstructed, on the basis of information derived from literature and databases, the first integrated genome-scale computational model of a transcriptional regulatory and metabolic network. The model accounts for 1,010 genes in Escherichia coli, including 104 regulatory genes whose products together with other stimuli regulate the expression of 479 of the 906 genes in the reconstructed metabolic network. This model is able not only to predict the outcomes of high-throughput growth phenotyping and gene expression experiments, but also to indicate knowledge gaps and identify previously unknown components and interactions in the regulatory and metabolic networks. We find that a systems biology approach that combines genome-scale experimentation and computation can systematically generate hypotheses on the basis of disparate data sources.},

Mathematical analysis can be performed to assess the capabilities of these reconstructed networks. The constraints-based framework, with flux balance analysis (FBA), has been used successfully to predict time course of growth and by-product secretion, effects of mutation and knock-outs, and gene expression profiles. However, FBA leads to incorrect predictions in situations where regulatory effects are a dominant influence on the behavior of the organism. Thus, there is a need to include regulatory events within FBA to broaden its scope and predictive capabilities. Here we represent transcriptional regulatory events as time-dependent constraints on the capabilities of a reconstructed metabolic network to further constrain the space of possible network functions. Using a simplified metabolic/regulatory network, growth is simulated under various conditions to illustrate systemic effects such as catabolite repression, the aerobic/anaerobic diauxic shift and amino acid biosynthesis pathway repression. The incorporation of transcriptional regulatory events in FBA enables us to interpret, analyse and predict the effects of transcriptional regulation on cellular metabolism at the systemic level.},

	Abstract = {In this report, a genome-scale reconstruction of Bacillus subtilis metabolism and its iterative development based on the combination of genomic, biochemical, and physiological information and high-throughput phenotyping experiments is presented. The initial reconstruction was converted into an in silico model and expanded in a four-step iterative fashion. First, network gap analysis was used to identify 48 missing reactions that are needed for growth but were not found in the genome annotation. Second, the computed growth rates under aerobic conditions were compared with high-throughput phenotypic screen data, and the initial in silico model could predict the outcomes qualitatively in 140 of 271 cases considered. Detailed analysis of the incorrect predictions resulted in the addition of 75 reactions to the initial reconstruction, and 200 of 271 cases were correctly computed. Third, in silico computations of the growth phenotypes of knock-out strains were found to be consistent with experimental observations in 720 of 766 cases evaluated. Fourth, the integrated analysis of the large-scale substrate utilization and gene essentiality data with the genome-scale metabolic model revealed the requirement of 80 specific enzymes (transport, 53; intracellular reactions, 27) that were not in the genome annotation. Subsequent sequence analysis resulted in the identification of genes that could be putatively assigned to 13 intracellular enzymes. The final reconstruction accounted for 844 open reading frames and consisted of 1020 metabolic reactions and 988 metabolites. Hence, the in silico model can be used to obtain experimentally verifiable hypothesis on the metabolic functions of various genes.},

	Abstract = {Eukaryotic cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems are limited, in part, by inefficient translation initiation. Here, we report three internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequences from the Dicistroviridae family that are highly active in yeast CFPS. These include the intergenic region (IGR) IRES from cricket paralysis virus (CrPV), plautia stali intestine virus (PSIV) and Solenopsis invicta virus 1 (SINV1). Optimization of combined transcription and translation (Tx/Tl) CFPS reactions primed with linear DNA containing the CrPV IGR IRES resulted in batch synthesis yields of 0.92$\pm$0.17μg/mL luciferase. Further template engineering, such as including the first 12 nt of native CrPV gene, increased yields to 2.33$\pm$0.11μg/mL. We next observed that the inclusion of a 50 nt poly(A) to the 3' end of the IGR IRES-mediated message increased yields an additional 81% to 4.33$\pm$0.37μg/mL, without any effect on mRNA stability or copy number. This was surprising because the CrPV IGR IRES requires no known translation initiation factors. Lastly, we investigated a method to inhibit background expression through competitive inhibition by supplying the reaction with 5' cap structure analog. This study highlights the crucial role translation initiation plays in yeast CFPS and offers a simple platform to study IRES sequences.},

We previously reported the advancement of a novel yeast-based CFPS platform. Here, we studied factors that cause termination of yeast CFPS batch reactions. Specifically, we characterized the substrate and byproduct concentrations in batch, fed-batch, and semi-continuous reaction formats through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and chemical assays. We discovered that creatine phosphate, the secondary energy substrate, and nucleoside triphosphates were rapidly degraded during batch CFPS, causing a significant drop in the reaction's energy charge (E.C.) and eventual termination of protein synthesis. As a consequence of consuming creatine phosphate, inorganic phosphate accumulated as a toxic byproduct. Additionally, we measured amino acid concentrations and found that aspartic acid was rapidly consumed. By adopting a semi-continuous reaction format, where passive diffusion enables substrate replenishment and byproduct removal, we achieved over a 70% increase in active superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) as compared with the batch system. This study identifies targets for the future improvement of the batch yeast CFPS reaction. Moreover, it outlines a detailed, generalized method to characterize and improve other CFPS platforms.},

	Abstract = {The rapid dissemination of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus emphasizes the need for universal influenza vaccines that would broadly protect against multiple mutated strains. Recent efforts have focused on the highly conserved hemagglutinin (HA) stem domain, which must undergo a significant conformational change for effective viral infection. Although the production of isolated domains of multimeric ectodomain proteins has proven difficult, we report a method to rapidly produce the properly folded HA stem domain protein from influenza virus A/California/05/2009 (H1N1) by using Escherichia coli-based cell-free protein synthesis and a simple refolding protocol. The T4 bacteriophage fibritin foldon placed at the C terminus of the HA stem domain induces trimer formation. Placing emphasis on newly exposed protein surfaces, several hydrophobic residues were mutated, two polypeptide segments were deleted, and the number of disulfide bonds in each monomer was reduced from four to two. High pH and Brij 35 detergent emerged as the most beneficial factors for improving the refolding yield. To stabilize the trimer of the HA stem-foldon fusion, new intermolecular disulfide bonds were finally introduced between foldon monomers and between stem domain monomers. The correct immunogenic conformation of the stabilized HA stem domain trimer was confirmed by using antibodies CR6261, C179, and FI6 that block influenza infection by binding to the HA stem domain trimer. These results suggest great promise for a broadly protective vaccine and also demonstrate a unique approach for producing individual domains of complex multimeric proteins.},

Cell-free systems, however, have been limited by their inability to co-activate multiple biochemical networks in a single integrated platform. Here, we report the assessment of biochemical reactions in an Escherichia coli cell-free platform designed to activate natural metabolism, the Cytomim system. We reveal that central catabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and protein synthesis can be co-activated in a single reaction system. Never before have these complex systems been shown to be simultaneously activated without living cells. The Cytomim system therefore promises to provide the metabolic foundation for diverse ab initio cell-free synthetic biology projects. In addition, we describe an improved Cytomim system with enhanced protein synthesis yields (up to 1200 mg/l in 2 h) and lower costs to facilitate production of protein therapeutics and biochemicals that are difficult to make in vivo because of their toxicity, complexity, or unusual cofactor requirements.},

Statistical inference methods have been widely applied to gain insight into which genes may influence the activities of others in a given omics data set, however, they do not provide information on the underlying mechanisms or whether the interactions are direct or distal. Biochemically, genetically, and genomically consistent knowledge bases are increasingly being used to extract deeper biological knowledge and understanding from these data sets than possible by inferential methods.

In this review, we provide an overview of these applications along with a critical assessment of their successes and limitations, and a perspective on likely future developments in the field. Taken together, the studies performed over the past decade have established a genome-scale mechanistic understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships in E. coli metabolism that forms the basis for similar efforts for other microbial species. Future challenges include the expansion of GEMs by integrating additional cellular processes beyond metabolism, the identification of key constraints based on emerging data types, and the development of computational methods able to handle such large-scale network models with sufficient accuracy.},

By explicitly considering experimental errors and in silico alternate optima in flux balance analysis, we systematically evaluate the capacity of 11 objective functions combined with eight adjustable constraints to predict (13)C-determined in vivo fluxes in Escherichia coli under six environmental conditions. While no single objective describes the flux states under all conditions, we identified two sets of objectives for biologically meaningful predictions without the need for further, potentially artificial constraints. Unlimited growth on glucose in oxygen or nitrate respiring batch cultures is best described by nonlinear maximization of the ATP yield per flux unit. Under nutrient scarcity in continuous cultures, in contrast, linear maximization of the overall ATP or biomass yields achieved the highest predictive accuracy. Since these particular objectives predict the system behavior without preconditioning of the network structure, the identified optimality principles reflect, to some extent, the evolutionary selection of metabolic network regulation that realizes the various flux states.},

In particular, constraints-based in silico models have been used to calculate optimal growth rates on common carbon substrates, and the results were found to be consistent with experimental data under many but not all conditions. Optimal biological functions are acquired through an evolutionary process. Thus, incorrect predictions of in silico models based on optimal performance criteria may be due to incomplete adaptive evolution under the conditions examined. Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 grows sub-optimally on glycerol as the sole carbon source. Here we show that when placed under growth selection pressure, the growth rate of E. coli on glycerol reproducibly evolved over 40 days, or about 700 generations, from a sub-optimal value to the optimal growth rate predicted from a whole-cell in silico model. These results open the possibility of using adaptive evolution of entire metabolic networks to realize metabolic states that have been determined a priori based on in silico analysis.},

Experiments with a feed mixture of glucose and pyruvate show multiple steady state behavior as predicted by the cybernetic model. When multiplicity occurs at a dilution (growth) rate, it results in hysteretic behavior following switches in dilution rate from above and below. This phenomenon is caused by transient paths leading to different steady states through dynamic maximization of the carbon uptake rate. Thus steady state multiplicity is a manifestation of the nonlinearity arising from cybernetic mechanisms rather than of the nonlinear kinetics. The predicted metabolic multiplicity would extend to intracellular states such as enzyme levels and fluxes to be verified in future experiments.},

The network model formulation is employed in the role of a diagnostic tool for the overproduction of threonine. More precisely, having determined a parameter set that describes the time evolution of a base strain (lysine producer), the model predicted response to genetic perturbations, designed to enhance the level of threonine, are simulated using an appropriately modified cybernetic model and compared with the experimental results of Stephanopoulos and Sinskey (Col{\'o}n et al., 1995a, Appl.

It is found that the model predicted response to enzymatic over-expression in the aspartate pathway agrees, for the most part, with experimental observations within the experimental error bounds.

Such models would realistically describe fundamental properties of living systems such as growth, division and chromosome replication. This will inevitably bridge bioinformatic technologies with ongoing mathematical modelling efforts and would allow for in silico prediction of important dynamic physiological events. To demonstrate a potential for the anticipated merger of bioinformatic genome-wide data with a whole-cell computer model, the authors present here an updated version of a dynamic model of Escherichia coli, including a module that correctly describes the initiation and control of DNA replication by nucleoprotein DnaA-ATP molecules. Specifically, a rigorous mathematical approach used to explicitly include the genome-wide distribution of DnaA-binding sites on the replicating chromosome into a computer model of a bacterial cell is discussed. A new simple deterministic approximation of the complex stochastic process of DNA replication initiation is also provided. It is shown for the first time that reasonable assumptions about the mechanism of DNA replication initiation can be implemented in a deterministic whole-cell model to make predictions about the timing of chromosome replication. Furthermore, it is proposed that a large increase in the concentration of DnaA-binding boxes will result in a decreased steady-state growth rate in E. coli.},

	Abstract = {A more complete understanding of the relationship of cell physiology to genomic structure is desirable. Because of the intrinsic complexity of biological organisms, only the simplest cells will allow complete definition of all components and their interactions. The theoretical and experimental construction of a minimal cell has been suggested as a tool to develop such an understanding. Our ultimate goal is to convert a "coarse-grain" lumped parameter computer model of Escherichia coli into a genetically and chemically detailed model of a "minimal cell." The base E. coli model has been converted into a generalized model of a heterotrophic bacterium. This coarse-grain minimal cell model is functionally complete, with growth rate, composition, division, and changes in cell morphology as natural outputs from dynamic simulations where only the initial composition of the cell and of the medium are specified. A coarse-grain model uses pseudochemical species (or modules) that are aggregates of distinct chemical species that share similar chemistry and metabolic dynamics. This model provides a framework in which these modules can be "delumped" into chemical and genetic descriptions while maintaining connectivity to all other functional elements. Here we demonstrate that a detailed description of nucleotide precursors transport and metabolism is successfully integrated into the whole-cell model. This nucleotide submodel requires fewer (12) genes than other theoretical predictions in minimal cells. The demonstration of modularity suggests the possibility of developing modules in parallel and recombining them into a fully functional chemically and genetically detailed model of a prokaryote cell.},

	Abstract = {A computer model is described which is capable of predicting changes in cell composition, cell size, cell shape, and the timing of chromosome synthesis in response to changes in external glucose limitation. The model is constructed primarily from information on unrestricted growth in glucose minimal medium. The ability of the model to make reasonable quantitative predictions under glucose-limitation is a test of the plausibility of the basic biochemical mechanisms included in the model. Such a model should be of use in differentiating among competing hypotheses for biological mechanisms and in suggesting as yet unobserved phenomena. The last two points are illustrated with the testing of a mechanism for the control of the initiation of DNA synthesis and predictions on cellwidth variations during the division cycle.},

	Abstract = {Predictive understanding of cell signaling network operation based on general prior knowledge but consistent with empirical data in a specific environmental context is a current challenge in computational biology. Recent work has demonstrated that Boolean logic can be used to create context-specific network models by training proteomic pathway maps to dedicated biochemical data; however, the Boolean formalism is restricted to characterizing protein species as either fully active or inactive. To advance beyond this limitation, we propose a novel form of fuzzy logic sufficiently flexible to model quantitative data but also sufficiently simple to efficiently construct models by training pathway maps on dedicated experimental measurements. Our new approach, termed constrained fuzzy logic (cFL), converts a prior knowledge network (obtained from literature or interactome databases) into a computable model that describes graded values of protein activation across multiple pathways. We train a cFL-converted network to experimental data describing hepatocytic protein activation by inflammatory cytokines and demonstrate the application of the resultant trained models for three important purposes: (a) generating experimentally testable biological hypotheses concerning pathway crosstalk, (b) establishing capability for quantitative prediction of protein activity, and (c) prediction and understanding of the cytokine release phenotypic response. Our methodology systematically and quantitatively trains a protein pathway map summarizing curated literature to context-specific biochemical data. This process generates a computable model yielding successful prediction of new test data and offering biological insight into complex datasets that are difficult to fully analyze by intuition alone.},
